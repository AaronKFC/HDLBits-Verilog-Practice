// In Verilog, the sensitivity list looks strange. The FF's reset is sensitive to the
// *level* of areset, so why does using "posedge areset" work?
// To see why it works, consider the truth table for all events that change the input 
// signals, assuming clk and areset do not switch at precisely the same time:

//  clk		areset		output
//   x		 0->1		q <= 0; (because areset = 1)
//   x		 1->0		no change (always block not triggered)
//  0->1	   0		q <= d; (not resetting)
//  0->1	   1		q <= 0; (still resetting, q was 0 before too)
//  1->0	   x		no change (always block not triggered)
